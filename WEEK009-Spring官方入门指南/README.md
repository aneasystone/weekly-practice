# WEEK009 - Spring 官方入门指南

[Spring 官方提供了大量的教程文档](https://spring.io/guides)，方便初学者快速入门，并且每篇教程都极具操作性，我们可以一步一步按顺序进行体验。这些教程被官方分为了三类：

* Getting Started Guides（耗时 15 到 30 分钟，完成一个 Hello World 类型的项目）
* Topical Guides（需要至少 1 小时的阅读和理解，提供一些覆盖面更广的内容）
* Tutorials（需要 2 - 3 小时才能完成，提供一些更深入的主题，并且更适用于真实场景）

不过我感觉这种分类方式并不是很友好，由于官方文档特别多，所以看上去显得乱糟糟的。我希望通过教程的内容来进行分类，在这篇笔记中，我将尝试着把 Spring 官方教程全部体验一遍，并按照我的理解来重新分类。
